    Enhance volume extend functionality in cinderlib by supporting the refresh
    of the host's view of an attached volume that has been extended in the
    backend to reflect the new size.  A call to volume.extend will
    automatically extend the view if the volume is locally attached and
    connection.extend will do the same when run on a non controller host.
