    Fake unused packages: Many packages that are automatically imported when
    loading cinder modules are only used for normal Cinder operation and are
    not necessary for cinderlib's execution.  For example when loading a Cinder
    module to get configuration options but without executing the code present
    in the module.

    We now fake these unnecessary packages, providing faster load times,
    reduced footprint, and the possibility for distributions to create a
    cinderlib package or containers with up to 40% fewer dependencies.
